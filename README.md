# ***Data-Structure***

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in **C++**. It is part of my learning journey as I explore the basics and deepen my understanding of how these modules work.

## **Data Structures Covered**

- **Linked List**: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A linked list where nodes contain references to both the next and the previous node.
- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Singleton Pattern**: A design pattern ensuring a single instance of a class.

## **Features**

- Modular and clean code organization.
- Comments explaining the logic behind the implementations.
- Each folder contains relevant code for the respective data structure.

## **Learning Goals**

- Understanding the core concepts of data structures.
- Building a strong foundation in C++ programming.
- Applying these structures in real-world scenarios.

## **Folder Structure**

├── LinkedList
├── Queue

```

## **How to Use**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sayan11071998/Data-Structure.git
cd Data-Structure
```

Compile and run the examples in the respective folders using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

### Example of a Linked List:
Here's a visualization of a singly linked list:

```plaintext
Head -> [1|*] -> [2|*] -> [3|NULL]
```

---

### Example of a Stack:
A stack works as follows:

1. Push elements onto the stack.
2. Pop elements off the stack (LIFO).

```plaintext
Stack:
-----
|  3  |
|  2  |
|  1  |
-----
```

### Example Images

You can add images to make the README more engaging. I'll generate a few visuals for a linked list and stack.

Here's a suggested README content for your Data Structure repository along with an image for enhancing its appearance:

# Data-Structure

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in C++. Each module is designed to provide a clear understanding of the concepts, helping in building a strong foundation in data structures.

## Modules Included
- **LinkedList**: Singly linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **DoublyLinkedList**: Doubly linked list implementation for bidirectional traversal.
- **Queue**: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure implemented using arrays.
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure with common operations like push, pop, and peek.
- **SingletonPattern**: Example of the singleton design pattern for managing single-instance objects.

## Learning Objectives
This repository aims to:
- Provide hands-on experience with basic data structures.
- Help understand the real-world use cases of data structures.
- Serve as a reference for beginners learning C++ and data structures.

## Linked List Visualization
Here is a simple diagram representing a linked list structure:

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayan11071998/Data-Structure.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired module directory:
   ```bash
   cd LinkedList
   ```
3. Compile and run the code:
   ```bash
   g++ LinkedList.cpp -o LinkedList
   ./LinkedList
   ```

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by adding new data structures or improving the existing ones.
